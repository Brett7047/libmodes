# libadsb

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/watson/libadsb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/watson/libadsb)

This is a C library for decoding ADS-B signals.

Most of the code is lifted from the
[dump1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090) project by Salvatore
Sanfilippo.

This is very much WIP.
